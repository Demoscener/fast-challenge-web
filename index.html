        <h1>Fast challenge: <br/>
        <b>make a demo in 24h</b></h1>

    
        <h2>wtf?</h2>
        For Deadline 2022 LJ and Virgill organized the fantastic "One Cube" - challenge: Just take this awesome soundtrack with a reasonably short length, and here is a theme that's open enough to make a fast demo about.
        <br/><br/>
        The results were 5 stunning fast entries for the anaglyph demo compo and a lot fun working together on stuff.


        <h2>Fast challenge 2: Inercia 2022</h2>

        So here comes installment #2. We will aim for Inercia 2022. 

        <br/>

        There will be a theme or a prompt, some random words that the demo should be about. We will publish them on friday<br/>
        This time the soundtrack is contributed by Gloom <br/>

        <br/><br/>
        In Berlin will have a coding jam at Pixtur's office in Wedding with Pandur, Lucid and others joining in.
        <br/><br/><br/>
        Results will be published on this page!

        <br/><br/>
        Join us! Have fun and remember: There is so little time there is no way you could screw this up (besides by not trying).
